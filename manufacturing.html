        <div class="description">
          <p>
            The population is approximately 5.2 million people with a growing rate; the city has experienced a 4.43%
            increase in population since 2021. The city's major economic activities encompass trade, manufacturing,
            transport, communication, education, health, social services, hotels, catering services, and agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Inflation and Consumer Impact:</b><br>
            High Inflation: Consumer buying power is being adversely affected by high inflation, especially in food
            prices, which have averaged 42%, surpassing the national average of 37%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Market and Traffic Ban Impact:</b><br>
            Traffic Ban: A traffic ban in the Addis market has disrupted the redistribution process and impacted the
            Profit and Loss (P&L) of OCCD.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sales and Outlets:</b><br>
            Outlets in Addis Ababa: The total outlet universe in Addis Ababa, including towns in the Oromia region and
            the newly formed Sheger Town, is over 46,440 outlets.<br>
            Serviced Outlets: Among these, 16,000 outlets are serviced weekly by sales representatives, focusing on High
            VPO (Volume Per Outlet) outlets.
          </p>
          <p>
            These points highlight the significant growth and economic challenges faced by Addis Ababa, particularly

          <img src="images/jemo location.png" />
          <p>Since 2005 Ethiopia has been implementing ambitious government-led low- and middle-income housing programs.
            The program has increased the number of homeowners and rental units in Addis city. Therefore, condominium
            houses have become the new way of life in Addis city, Addis up countries, and the top ten cities.
            Approximately, there are more than 175,000 units of multistory condominiums have been completed in over 100
            sites throughout the city, with an additional 132,000 housing units under construction.
            These sites bring an opportunity to increase our market share through the availability of our products. In
            most cases, the ground floor of the buildings is allocated for the business center, which has a high
            potential for the development of new accounts and creating visibility.
