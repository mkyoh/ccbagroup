          <p>
            <b>Market and Traffic Ban Impact:</b><br>
            Traffic Ban: A traffic ban in the Addis market has disrupted the redistribution process and impacted the

          <p>Since 2005 Ethiopia has been implementing ambitious government-led low- and middle-income housing programs.
            The program has increased the number of homeowners and rental units in Addis city. Therefore, condominium
            houses have become the new way of life in Addis city, Addis up countries, and the top ten cities.
            Approximately, there are more than 175,000 units of multistory condominiums have been completed in over 100
            sites throughout the city, with an additional 132,000 housing units under construction.
            These sites bring an opportunity to increase our market share through the availability of our products. In
            most cases, the ground floor of the buildings is allocated for the business center, which has a high
            potential for the development of new accounts and creating visibility.
